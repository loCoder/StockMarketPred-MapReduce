Test 1:

There are 3 MR separate code, each for getting daily, monthly and yearly averages of adj_close price

Dataset record structure: Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume

In v1, the MR removes invalid records, where there's any non numerical value for adj_close

In v2, code includes the null values, and does not reject them. Instead null is replaced by '-1'.
For adj_close as -1, while taking average in monthly and yearly, these values are ignored completely.
For further processing -1 should be considered equivalent to null value(Caution: since double is being used, it may be possible that the value may not be exactly -1 but nearest double-floating point. You may in that case, approx the -ve value to nearest integer, or use any negative number as 'null' value, since stock prices wont go negative)
